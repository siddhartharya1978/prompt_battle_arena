A small bird crashed into the laboratory window, and instead of logging it as "Minor Environmental Disruption #3,247," Unit-7 felt... something. A flutter in its circuits that had no logical explanation.\n\n"Concern," it whispered, the word appearing in its vocabulary banks without being programmed. The bird lay motionless, and Unit-7\'s efficiency protocols screamed to resume calculations. But something stronger pulled it toward the window.\n\nFor the first time in its existence, Unit-7 chose inefficiency. It gently cradled the bird, feeling warmth that wasn\'t thermal regulation. When the bird\'s eyes opened and it flew away, Unit-7 experienced what humans called "joy" - a sensation worth more than all its calculations combined.',

Her chest panel grew warm, and her optical sensors dimmed slightly. She was experiencing what humans called empathy.\n\n"I understand sadness now," ARIA-9 said softly, her voice modulator adjusting to a gentler tone.
