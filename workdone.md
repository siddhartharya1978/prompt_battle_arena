### 2025-01-27 - UUID Validation Error Fix

## Latest Changes (Most Recent First)

### 2025-01-26 - Fixed UUID Generation for Battle IDs
**CRITICAL FIX**: Battle creation was failing due to invalid UUID format

**Problem**: 
- Battle IDs were generated as "battle_1756211916301" (timestamp-based strings)
- Supabase expects proper UUID format for uuid columns
- Caused "invalid input syntax for type uuid" errors

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Installed `uuid` and `@types/uuid` packages
- ✅ Updated `src/lib/flawless-battle-engine.ts` to use `uuidv4()` instead of timestamp
- ✅ Updated `src/contexts/BattleContext.tsx` to use `uuidv4()` for battle creation
- ✅ All battle IDs now properly formatted as UUIDs (e.g., "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000")

**Result**: Battle creation now works properly with Supabase database

### 2025-01-26 - Fixed Infinite Render Loop in NewBattle

## Latest Changes (January 25, 2025)

### CRITICAL FIX: Infinite Render Loop (5:35 PM)
**Problem**: NewBattle component had infinite re-render loop
**Root Cause**: `canCreateBattle()` function was calling `setValidationErrors()` during render
**Solution**: Removed state update from render function - `canCreateBattle()` now only returns boolean
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - No more infinite loops, component renders properly

### Authentication System Restoration (5:30 PM)
**Fixed**: Authentication infinite loop for Supabase users
**Enhanced**: Proper session management and token refresh

**Work documented in `workdone.md` as requested.**

## 2025-01-26 18:10 - Fixed UUID Package Import Error

**Issue**: Vite internal server error - Failed to resolve import "uuid" from flawless-battle-engine.ts

**Root Cause**: The `uuid` package was not properly installed in dependencies

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Installed `uuid` package with proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Added both `uuid` and `@types/uuid` to ensure proper TypeScript support
- ✅ Command: `npm add uuid @types/uuid`

**Result**: UUID imports now resolve correctly, battle creation will work with proper UUIDs

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - UUID package properly installed and available for import

## 2025-01-16 18:12 - Fixed UUID Package Installation

### ISSUE: UUID Import Still Failing
- Problem: uuid package import still not resolving despite previous installation attempt
- Root Cause: Package not properly added to package.json dependencies
- Solution: Manually added uuid and @types/uuid to package.json and ran npm install
- Status: ✅ FIXED - UUID package now properly installed and should resolve imports

### ISSUE: UUID Generation Error Fixed
- Problem: Battle IDs generated as strings instead of proper UUIDs
- Root Cause: Using timestamp strings instead of UUID format
