## Latest Changes (Most Recent First)

### 2025-01-26 - Fixed UUID Generation for Battle IDs
**CRITICAL FIX**: Battle creation was failing due to invalid UUID format

**Problem**: 
- Battle IDs were generated as "battle_1756211916301" (timestamp-based strings)
- Supabase expects proper UUID format for uuid columns
- Caused "invalid input syntax for type uuid" errors

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Installed `uuid` and `@types/uuid` packages
- ✅ Updated `src/lib/flawless-battle-engine.ts` to use `uuidv4()` instead of timestamp
- ✅ Updated `src/contexts/BattleContext.tsx` to use `uuidv4()` for battle creation
- ✅ All battle IDs now properly formatted as UUIDs (e.g., "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000")

**Result**: Battle creation now works properly with Supabase database

### 2025-01-26 - Fixed Infinite Render Loop in NewBattle

## Latest Changes (January 25, 2025)

### CRITICAL FIX: Infinite Render Loop (5:35 PM)
**Problem**: NewBattle component had infinite re-render loop
**Root Cause**: `canCreateBattle()` function was calling `setValidationErrors()` during render
**Solution**: Removed state update from render function - `canCreateBattle()` now only returns boolean
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - No more infinite loops, component renders properly

### Authentication System Restoration (5:30 PM)
**Fixed**: Authentication infinite loop for Supabase users
**Enhanced**: Proper session management and token refresh

**Work documented in `workdone.md` as requested.**
